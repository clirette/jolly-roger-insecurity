And let's go !!!\n\n<Watch the YouTube video>\n\nYou see, we've encrypted the phrase and here it is RBZTXYZJSKZBLQCEN\n\nCool!\n\nNow I'll encode a famous story and you'll try to decode it. By the way, it's much more interesting to read the whole story over, isn't it?\n\n....\n\nThat's complicated. Maybe I have to find a key at first. I'd better look for someone who is able to solve this...\n\nDon't forget to reach to the end of the text! The ending is greatly important.\n",
