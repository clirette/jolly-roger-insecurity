# Disassemblers
[Binary Ninja](https://binary.ninja)
 is a new proprietary disassembler that is fairly affordable (at ~$100 for a personal license) with a
much cleaner interface than IDA. There are no decompilers for it now, but those may be available in the future.

[IDA/IDA Pro](https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/)
 is a proprietary disassembler that allows for disassembly of binaries for a large variety of processors. It has a GUI that gives the ability to analyze code by blocks. It allows for commenting line-by-line as well as the renaming of variables to assist in reverse engineering projects. Decompilation plugins are available (at a price).

[Radare2](http://www.radare.org/r/)
 is a free reverse engineering framework for binary analysis, also providing for a large number of architectures. It is scriptable, and provides many of the same features as IDA.
