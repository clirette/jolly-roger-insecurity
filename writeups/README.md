Intended to serve as a repo for past CTF challenges, this repo should organize
them first in folders by CTF, within that, folders by year, and within those,
by challenge category, within a separate folder for each challenge. Each
challenge folder's README should detail that challenge's description.

Note that this repository is not for writeups and will likely contain challenges
intended for use in the future. That being said, this repo is for Jolly Roger
Insecurity officer access ONLY if at all possible, as it will hold source,
backends, etc.
