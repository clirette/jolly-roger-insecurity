# My (Will's) solution for Judgement

When reversing the file, the vulnerability in this program was apparent before
too long. The program accepts user input (the potential flag), uses a printf to 
print it back out, and then says whether the flag is correct. The user input
that goes to the printf is accepted in the getnline function. It checks for
unprintable characters and will error out if those are provided, so providing
escaped addresses directly through input won't work! It also checks for a
newline to replace that with a null character for C string termination, and
input is limited to 0x40 characters as well.

However, because this printf accepts user input with no prior format string
argument, we can provide a format string ourselves. Without an initial
format string argument, if a user provides format characters (%c, %x, etc.),
printf will assume that there are arguments provided on the stack and will
happily consume whatever's on the stack for as many format characters are
provided.
